# Club Center Website Project @ South Seattle College
This is the development repository for the Club Center Website Project.

## About the Project
This project is built in ExpressionEngine (or "EE" for short). Because of this, a few files are necessarily ignored by Git (defined in the .gitignore file at the root). These files are ignored for security reasons. Take a look at the [.gitignore file](https://github.com/SSC-HoCgroup/cc-website/blob/master/.gitignore) for full details. 

Most notable of these omissions are the **config.php** and **database.php** files. When setting up this EE project in your personal repo, you will need to put a copy of these files in your project in order for the system to function properly. Blank copies of these files, as well as the EE installer, can be found in the [-untracked- folder](https://github.com/SSC-HoCgroup/cc-website/tree/master/-untracked-files-) at the root of this project. If you aren't working from an existing EE installation, place the installer folder in the system folder, and go to [http://yourdomain.com/admin.php](http://yourdomain.com/admin.php).

Further instructions for installing and configuring ExpressionEngine can be found in [EE's User Guide](https://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/).
